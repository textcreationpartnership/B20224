            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is almost incredible that in a Christian Kingdom, such a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duty as Family and Closet-Prayer should need any preface, or arguments to perswade to its pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; yet the Prodigious licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and degeneracy of this age, seems almost to call in question the very first principles of Religion: the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of bold men make many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume almost to deny a deity; but to such I shall not address my self, but leave them before Gods Tribunal,
<pb facs="tcp:205425:3"/>whose being if they will not believe, his terrors and sharp displeasure they shall undoubtedly feel.</p>
            <p>My design here is only to tell the honest Christian his duty in a few words. The backwardness of men to pray, argues spiritual danger, and a great unwillingness to be religious; and yet this is a duty Commanded, and commended: it is also an act of the highest grace and honour, that we poor sinful dust and ashes should be admitted to come into the presence of the Eternal God, and lay open our wants and complain of our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and beg support, and succour, and deliverance, and salvation; we have many gracious promises that he will hear our prayers, and he hath appointed his only Son to be our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor at the Throne of Grace for us: Oh infinite condescension of the great God to such worthless worms as we are! Of the great power and vertue of Prayer the holy Scripture
<pb facs="tcp:205425:3"/>gives sundry instances; by Prayer Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Kingdoms have been saved from ruine, Prayer hath raised the dead to life again, it hath stopped the violence of fire, shut up the mouths of wild-beasts; it hath made the Sun go back, and the Moon to stand still. What need I say more of this holy fire? This the Scripture saith of those that do not pray, <hi>That the Lord will pour out his wrath on the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and on the families that call not upon his name.</hi> Now Christian Reader, this Little Book I present thee as a choice manual for thy daily devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; here is much in a little, here thou maist find petitions for all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. It was composed on purpose for such who want those natural en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and qualifications which others are furnished with. I hope thou wilt not carp at it because they are forms. It is not my business here to dispute with those who can or do pray without a form, much less to
<pb facs="tcp:205425:4"/>undervalue the publick forms of the Church, but that it may answer the end of the Composing is the daily Prayer of your unworthy Orator,</p>

            <head>A Morning Prayer for a Family.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Most Great, most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and most Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord God, whose all-seeing eye is present in all places, and at all times, but especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there graciously and spiritually where thy name is called upon, though but two or three be gathered together; we sinful worms are met together this morning in the fear of thy Great Name, to offer up this our morning sacrifice, encouraged by thine own command and promise, and the mediation of Jesus Christ. Holy Lord be pleased to cause the fear and dread of thy great Name to fall upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:205425:8"/>us, and be present with us and Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over us. We poor worthless creatures do humbly cast down our selves before thee to acknowledge thy mercies, to confess our sins, to beg thy grace, and to render thee our praise and service: be pleased by the assistances of thy Spirit to teach us thy Children how to pray, and for what to pray; let thy Spirit make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession in all our souls; by it let us be enabled to cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father. We thank and praise thy glorious and holy Name, that we who were born in sin, were not forsaken by thee to live and dye in our sin, and that we were not left with the Devils to helpless desperation, but by an all-sufficient Saviour that we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by his blood and have a free pardon to life, in his Covenant of Grace, to all that accept of him for their Lord and Saviour. For ever blessed be God for his holy Gospel, his holy Spirit, and his holy Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We thank thee for our peace,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205425:8"/>liberty, and all our comforts of this life: we thank thee for all our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private helps towards this and a better life in all the means of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>But especially that thou hast bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed these means for our good, and hast not given us over to a blind mind, a hard heart, and to the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of our perverse wills. How great was that mercie, that not only spared our lives and kept us out of Hell when we were sinning against thee; but at last convinced us of sin and misery, and awakened our sleepy souls unto repentance, and made us know the vanity of this world, and the certainty and glory of the life to come, that we might know thee and seek thee our end and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! How great was thy mercy in discovering to us the great mysteries of thy Gospel, and to draw us to thy Son as the way to Thee! But O the ill requital that we have made for all that love! Our original sin hath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205425:9"/>been too fruitful in our wicked lives. How long did we forget God and our souls, our death, and our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting concerns? What strangers were we to the life of Faith? And before the hatred of sin, and love of holiness was minded by us? and since we gave up our selves to thy holy Covenant, we have often yielded to temptations, loved thee coldly, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee slothfully, and lived unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and made little improvement of thy mercies and of our afflictions, for which thou mightest justly have withdrawn thy Spirit from us, and suffered us to return to our first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done condition.</p>
            <p>But for Jesus sake charge not upon us the sins of our corrupt nature, or of our lives; of Childhood or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Age; our sins of omission or commission, of knowledge or of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, of rashness or of negligence.</p>
            <p>In the name of our Redeemer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept us and pardon us; O give us his Spirit the greatest of all gifts!</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:205425:9"/>
            <p>Let a new nature, a holy life, a living to thee and a dying to sin, with a holy light be our portion: O let not our ignorance and unbelief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: let none of this worlds plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, riches or honours ever steal our hearts from thee!</p>
            <p>Let not our fleshly lusts overcome thy Spirit! Govern our affections, thoughts, words and actions, our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, our appetites and our passions by thy Grace. Deliver us from selfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and teach us to love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as our selves, and to wrong no man in our thoughts, or words, or deeds; but to do all the good that we can to the souls and bodies of others. Save us from the hellish sin of Pride, and all the fruits of it; make us loath our selves for all our, sins.</p>
            <p>Make us faithful in all the duties of our relations, in Kingdom, Church and Family, as we are Superiors, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors or Equals; mercifully dispose of our persons, our friends and our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205425:10"/>affairs. Provide for and protect our bodies, and make us contented with our daily bread, and patient if for our sins we want it.</p>
            <p>Be merciful to the afflicted, deliver the sick, the poor, the oppressed, and the broken-hearted, as is most for their own and others good, and for thy Glory. Continue thy Gospel, bless the King and all in Authority, with wisdom, holiness and justice; teach them to govern, and us to obey; let the Kingdoms of the world be the Kingdoms of Christ.</p>
            <p>Great art thou, O Lord, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be feared, wise art thou, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to be obeyed; good art thou, and unmeasurably to be beloved: For of thee, and through thee, and to thee are all things: to thee be the Glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>An Evening Prayer for a Private Family.</head>
            <p>MOST Glorious God, the Creator of all things; the Owner and the Ruler of the World, but especially of thy Church and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen ones: thy Children redeemed by Jesus Christ thy Son, and regenerated by thy Holy Spirit, have leave to call thee their reconciled Father.</p>
            <p>O with what wondrows love hast thou loved us, That of Rebells we should be made the Sons of God!</p>
            <p>Thou hast advanced us that we might be wholly devoted to thee, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully to obey thee, and entirely to love thee.</p>
            <p>O cause both us, and all thine, and all the world, to hallow thy holy name, and to live to thee.</p>
            <p>And cause us to cast off the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Sathan and the flesh, and to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Scepter of thy Son; O perfect the Kingdom of Grace in our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:205425:11"/>souls, and hasten the Kingdom of Glory.</p>
            <p>Cause men to understand, believe and obey the Gospel of Salvation.</p>
            <p>And because our being is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our well-being, maintain us in the life which thou hast here given us, until the work of life be finisht; give us health of mind and body, protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and supply of all our wants, as shall best fit us for our duty; and make us contented with our daily bread, and patient if we want it.</p>
            <p>Save us from the love of Riches, Honours and Pleasures of this world, and the Pride, Idleness and Sensuality which they cherish.</p>
            <p>And cause us to serve thy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by our diligent labours, and to serve thee faithfully with all that thou givest us.</p>
            <p>And through the merits of thy Son forgive us all our sins original and actual, from our birth to this hour; our sins of heart, of word and deed; our secret and our open sins, our sins
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:205425:11"/>of negligence and ignorance, but especially our sins against knowledge and Conscience; let not our sin find us out to ruine us, but let us find out our sin truly to repent of it and forsake it. O punish us not with the loss of thy Grace! Take not thy Holy Spirit from us, and deny us not his assistance and holy operations. Seal to us by thy Spirit the pardon of our sins, give us the joy of thy favour and salvation. And let thy love and mercy to us, fill us with thankfulness towards thee, and love and mercy to our Brethren and our Enemies.</p>
            <p>Suffer us not to cast our selves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into Temptations, but careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid them, and resolutely to resist and conquer what we cannot avoid; O mortifie those inward sins and lusts, and most dangerous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</p>
            <p>Suffer us not be tempted by Satan or the word, or tryed by thy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, above the strength which thy Grace shall give us.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:205425:12"/>
            <p>Save us from a fearless confidence in our own strength: and let us not dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the snare, nor taste the bait, nor play with the fire of thy wrath; but cause us to fear and to depart from evil; lest before we be aware we be intangled and overcome and wounded with our guilt and thy wrath.</p>
            <p>And as we crave all this from thee, we humbly tender our praises with our future service to thee. Thou art the King of all the world, and thy Kingdom is everlasting.</p>
            <p>Blessed are all thy faithful Subjects, the whole creation proclaiming thy perfection: In Heaven the blessed see thy glory, and the glory of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; of thee, and through thee, and to thee are all things: To thee be glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>A Prayer and Praise for the Lords-day.</head>
            <p>GLorious <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who art infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above the praise of men and Angels; much more of us sinful worms: All that we can do, can add nothing unto thy blessedness, but thy love and mercy hath advanced us to this honour, and made our own fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity our duty: It is good for us to draw near to thee! And lest the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and business of this world should hinder us, thou hast appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us this thy special day, that our composed minds might be taken up, with thy love and praise, and might attend upon thee without distraction, and might have a fore-tast of our Everlasting Rest.</p>
            <p>O be thou this day to thy servants souls, the spirit of Love, of Life, of Light and of Power!</p>
            <p>That the Heavenly life may quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken us to this holy and heavenly work; O let the sacrifice of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205425:13"/>and of our Praises, which we humbly offer according to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, be such as are fit for thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, through Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Thou and thou alone art God; Immortal, Invisible, Eternal and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Being and Perfections! from everlasting to everlasting thou art God.</p>
            <p>Thou art the Almighty and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is too hard for thee, thou broughtest all things out of nothing!</p>
            <p>Thou gavest Being to the glorious Angels, the Heavens were made by thee, thou madest the Sun and Stars.</p>
            <p>Thou madest the Earth, the Land and Sea, and all the Creatures that dwell therein: All fowl and fishes, beasts and plants. The air and clouds, the thunder and lightning, the rain and snow, the winds and earth-quakes, the marvellous motions of the sea, are all thy great unsearchable works.</p>
            <p>The smallest worm or flower doth far surpass our knowledge: but Man thou hast made the noblest piece of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205425:13"/>this lower world: Thou breathedst into him the breath of life, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest him little lower than the Angels, thou madest him in thine own Image, thou becamest a Father to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his owner, his ruler and his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est good; Thou deniest thy mercy to none but the obstinate and final rejecters of it.</p>
            <p>Thou givest eternal life to them who were the sons of Death; and this life is in thy Son: for he is able to the uttermost to save all that come unto thee by him.</p>
            <p>O with what love hast thou loved poor rebellious sinners, that they should be converted and be made the sons of God, yea heirs of Heaven! Thou hast built thy Church upon the Rock, the blessed Mediator; That the power of Hell may not prevail against it. He is the Lord both of dead and living.</p>
            <p>How glorious art thou, O Lord, in holiness! we bless thy name, O our great Creator! we bless thy name,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:205425:14"/>our gracious Redeemer! we bless thy name most holy spirit!</p>
            <p>Return, O Lord, deliver our souls! Kill us not till our sins be killed! End not this life till thou hast prepared us for a better! Cut not off my Time till I am prepared for eternity.</p>
            <p>Have mercy upon undone souls, now glorifie thy grace in Jesus Christ who is an allsufficient Saviour, to whom we fly, and on whom we cast our miserable souls.</p>
            <p>Let us by thee be reconciled to the Father, and present us spotless and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; whether we live or die we desire to be thine, accept and assure us of the blessings of thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant! and then though we deserve to dwell with Devils, we shall see thy Glory, and be filled with thy love, and with Saints and Angels shall joyfully praise our Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier for ever. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <p>GLorious <hi>Jehovah,</hi> while Angels and the spirits of the Just made perfect are praising thee in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of thy glory, we have the same most holy God to praise; and though we see thee not, our Head and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth, and our faith also discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee in the glass of thy holy word and works. Though we are sinners, and unworthy, and cannot touch these holy things, without the marks of our pollution; yet we have a great High-Priest with thee, who was separate from sinners, holy, harmless and undefiled, who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for us, in the merits of his spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less life and sacrifice, by whose hands only we dare presume to present a facifice to the most holy God.</p>
            <p>This day past thou hast ordained to be a day of holy rest, as a Type and means of that Heavenly Rest with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:205425:15"/>thy triumphant Church, to which we aspire, and for which we hope.</p>
            <p>Thou didst accept their low praise on earth, before they celebrated thy praise in Glory:</p>
            <p>Accept ours also by the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>
            <p>Glory be to thee, O God, in the highest, on earth peace, good-will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men: Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty, who wast, and art, and art to come; eternal without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end; infinitely powerful, wise and good. Of thee, and through thee, and to thee are all things, to thee be glory for evermore. We praise and glorifie thee our Lord and owner; for we and all things are thine own. We praise and glorifie thee our King and Ruler; for we are thy subjects, and our perfect obedience is thy due. Just are all thy laws and judgements; true and sure is all thy word. We praise and glorifie thee our great benefactor; in thee we live and move; and all that we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:205425:15"/>are, or have, or can do, is wholly from thee, the cause of all: and all is for thee; for thou art our end. Delightfully to love thee, is our greatest duty, and our only felicity: for thou art love it self, and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amiable.</p>
            <p>When we forsook thee, thou didst not utterly forsake us: when we had lost our selves, and by sin became thine enemies, condemn'd by thy Law; thy mercy pitied us, and gave us the promise of a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

O death where is thy sting, O grave where is thy victory! Our Saviour is ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Father and our Father, to his God and our God, and we shall ascend! To his hands we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our departing souls. Our head is glorified, and it is his will and promise that we shall be with him where he is to see his glory!

            <p>We praise and glorifie this spirit of Life, with the Father and the Son from whom he is sent, to be light and life, and love to our dead, and dark, and disaffected souls.</p>

            <head>A Prayer for Munday morning</head>
            <p>O Most Great, most Wise and Gracious Lord, we desire through the mediation of our Lord Jesus, to cast down our selves at the foot-stool of thy grace. Humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our great folly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious provocations that we stand guilty of, having wilfully forgotten thee the God that made us, and the Saviour that redeemed us, and the great business we came into this world for, and the endless glory set before us; whereas had we lived to those high and holy ends for which we were created and redeemed, we might have come to thee with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boldness and confidence as thy Children. We acknowledge we have lived as if we had been made for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:205425:17"/>but to pass a few days in flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasure, and to pamper our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses for worms: we have wilfully forgot what it is to be made men and women, who have reason given us to rule our flesh, and to know our God, and to foresee our death, and the state of immortality: But we have made our Reason a servant to our Senses, and have lived too like the Beasts that perish. O the pretious time that we have lost, which all the world cannot call back! O the calls of Grace which we have neglected, and the motions and teachings of God which we have resisted! the wonderful love which we unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have rejected, and the manifold mercies which we have abused, and turned into wantonness and sin! How deep is the guilt which we have contracted! And how great are the comforts which we have lost! We might have lived all our times in the love of thee our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God; and in the delights of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:205425:18"/>thy holy word and ways; in the daily sweet fore-sight of Heaven, and in the joy of the Holy-Ghost; would we have been ruled by thy righteous and holy Laws.</p>
            <p>But we have hearkned to the flesh and this deceitful world; and have preferred a short and sinful life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy love and endless glory.</p>
            <p>Ever since we came into the world sin and folly have taken up our time. We are ashamed to look back upon the years which we have spent: and to think of the temptations which we have yielded to! Alas what trifles have enticed us from our God? How little have we had for that holy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which we have lost? Like <hi>Esau</hi> we have prophanely sold our Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for one Morsel. To please our fancie, and appetite, and our lust, we have set by all the joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! We have unkindly despised the goodness of our Maker; we have slighted the love and grace of our Redeemen! We have resisted thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:205425:18"/>spirit, silenced our own consciences, and grieved thy spirit. Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est our secret sins, which are unknown to men, with all their aggravations they may justly find us out! If we look behind us, we see our sins pursue our souls, as an enemie ready to overtake and devour us! If we look before us, we see thy just and dreadful judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and we know that thou wile not acquit the guilty! If we look within us, we see dark defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hearts; If we look without us, we see a world still offering fresh temptations to deceive us! If we look above us, we see thine offended dreadful Majesty! If we look beneath us, we see the place of endless tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the company with which we deserve to suffer!</p>
            <p>But yet when we look to thine abundant mercy, and to thy Son, and to thy Covenant, we have hope.</p>
            <p>Thy goodness is equal to thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Thou are love it self; and thy mercy is over all thy works:</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:205425:19"/>
            <p>O therefore behold us prostrate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which are ashamed to look up towards Heaven, O God be merciful to us sinners. O forgive not only our original sin, but the sins and follies of youth, sins of ignorance and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of negligence and wilfulness; of omission and commission; against the law of nature, and against the Grace and Gospel of thy Son! for thy abundant mercy, and merit of thy Son. Put thy fear into our hearts that we may never depart from thee: let the world be crucified to us, and we to it, by the Cross of Christ.</p>
            <p>Let us neither love it nor the things therein, but having food and rayment, cause us therewith to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Keep us from snares and ways of sin, let us never return again to folly, nor forget the Covenant of our God.</p>
            <p>Prepare us for death and for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that when we come to leave this world, we may be found in Christ, having the righteousness which

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:205425:21"/>we have forgotten our God, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our souls, and our blessed hopes of Immortality; and have only mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the things of this visible transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry world, and the prosperity and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this corruptible flesh, which we know must shortly turn to rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and dust.</p>
            <p>Thou gavest us a Law which was both just and good, to guide us in the way to life; and when by sin we had lost our selves, Thou gavest us a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, even thy eternal word made man, who by his holy life and bitter sufferings reconciled us to thee, who not only purchased salvation for us, but revealed it to us. But O how light have we set by this our Merciful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer! and by all that love which thou hast graciously manifested by him! and how little have we either stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died or understood, much less obeyed that Covenant of Grace which thou hast made by thim to lost mankind!</p>
            <p>But, O God, be merciful to us vile miserable undone sinners! Forgive the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:205425:21"/>sins of our natural pravity, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ignorance and negligence, omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and commissions of our lives: And give us true repentance for them.</p>
            <p>O wo to us that ever we were born, if thou forgive not our sins, and make us not holy before this short uncertain life be at an end! We know that all our life is but the time which thy mercy allotteth us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death.</p>
            <p>O let us not therefore put off our repentance and preparation to a sick-bed: But now, Lord, as if it were our last and dying words, we earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly beg thy pardoning &amp; sanctifying grace through the merits and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of our Redeemer! O thou that hast pitied and saved so many great and miserable sinners, save us also, that we with them may glorifie thee for ever; hadst thou been unwilling to shew mercy, thou wouldst not have ransomed us by so precious a price, and still intreat us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to thee. We have no cause
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:205425:22"/>to distrust thy truth or goodness; but we are afraid lest unbelief, and pride, and hypocrisie, and a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fleshly mind should be our ruine.</p>
            <p>O save us from Satan and this tempting world, but especially from our selves: teach us to deny all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness and fleshly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present evil world. Let it be our chief daily work to please thee, and to lay up a treasure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to make sure of a blessed life with Christ, and quietly to trust thee with soul and body. Make us faithful in our Callings, and in our duties to one another; cause us and all thine to seek first the hallowing of thy Name, the coming of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and the doing of thy Will on Earth as it is done in Heaven; give us all things necessary to life and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienss, and let us be therewith content.</p>
            <p>Forgive us our daily sins, and let thy love and mercy constrain us to love thee above all; and for thy sake
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205425:22"/>to love our Neighbours as our selves, and in all our dealings, to do justly and mercifully, as we would have others do by us. Keep us from hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temptations, from sin and from thy Judgements, and from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of our spiritual and corporal ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: make all our Religion and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diential walking delightful to us; and let our souls delight in the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of thy Kingdom, Power and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it may secure and sweeten our labour by day and our rest by night. Keep us in a longing and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hope of the Heavenly Glory; and let the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Love of God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Communion of the Holy Spirit be with us, now and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>O Eternal and most Gracious Lord God, thou art worthy of all our love, service and obedience. We thy poor unregenerate and unsanctified creatures by nature, humbly prostrate our selves before thee this morning, to render in and through the Name of our blessed Redeemer, our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgement for all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued mercies, and for all the good hopes through Grace of the comfortable expectation that we through him have of a future enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Glory: supply our inward man more and more with renewed strength of Grace, and Heavenly-mindedness; give us the witness of thy Spirit and the Comforts that are promised to all that are thy redeemed ones: let our testimony within be manifested to us by this; that we that know thy name and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205425:23"/>name thy name, have made it our great design to depart from all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; let it appear that we are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten again by the seed incorruptible to a lively hope, and a transforming power; let all our old natures pass away, let all become new, and let the sense of this great change cause us to rejoyce with joy unspeakable and full of glory; enable us daily to give all diligence to make our calling and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction sure, by the greatest of our care, and above all our gettings to get this witnessed by the daisy exercise of all those graces and duties that are conduceable thereunto. Let nothing lye so near our hearts as the sad consideration of the ways and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courses of sin that we then so much delighted in. Oh the sad fruits of those ways of sin, at the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof we desire from our souls to take to our selves shame, sorrow and confusion of face.</p>
            <p>For ever praised be our Lord Jesus that we were as brands pluckt out of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205425:24"/>the fire, that our Sun did not set, and our day expire before we were warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and awakened out of our wicked, carnal, earthly, sensual and devillish course; we were running to our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting destruction, had not tender love and bowels of mercy prevented us.</p>
            <p>Blessed be God that we were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented of our good things as we then thought them; a life of sport and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and all that this world can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford will prove as it did to <hi>Dives,</hi> to day enjoyment of all the good that earth can afford, and the next news of him is, he is in Hell tormented and wanting a drop of water.</p>
            <p>Make us more and more sensible that unsanctified wealth and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures leave nothing but a sting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and prepare the enjoyers of them only for everlasting wo.</p>
            <p>Preserve us from all those beastly pleasures that would deprive us of everlasting joyes.</p>
            <p>Give us a serious consideration of our later end; when death comes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205425:24"/>time is gone, for ever gone, and all the world cannot recall it, and that our great business in this world was to prepare for Heaven, and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing happiness: And that it must go with all men in Heaven and Hell, as they have prepared here.</p>
            <p>Give us a serious consideration of the uncertainty of our lives. Alas how is it with all that are gone before us at their souls appearance in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world? how is it with Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Have we ever thought seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously of the end of our prosperity?</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205425:25"/>for all thy continued mercies from day to day. O give us serious thoughts of our later end, give us good hope through grace, at our down-lying, of a future Glory; let us not sleep with vain hopes of Heaven and the Glory to come in the other world.</p>
            <p>Let the great work and business of each day we live, be to make sure for a blessed eternity. Give us to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the danger of sleeping without hopes of a better life, when this is ended. Let us fear lest we should dye and be past hope before the morning. Let us not live negligently or unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredly one day more, lest we turn Gods merciful patience and mercy towards us, into presumption against him, to the hardning of our hearts and the delaying of our repentance; give us to consider thy long forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the danger of our delay, knowing that certainly death will come, and how soon we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uncertain; give us seriously to bethink our selves, what it is for a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205425:25"/>soul to take its farewell of this world, and presently to appear in another, and to be judged according to its preparation made in this life; and to take up a place in Heaven or Hell, without any hopes of ever changing.</p>
            <p>O that we might seriously consider, though death cannot be prevented, damnation may be prevented, and Hell may be prevented, and escaped by fear and care and diligence: let us rather choose to betake our selves to our duty and avoid sin and danger: is Hell easier, than fear and care to offend?</p>
            <p>Give us to consider that we must live for ever: and that we may live in Heavenly joys for ever, if in due time we will use the means: let us bethink our selves for what end God gave us our reason and did difference us from beasts, that it was for us to use by preparing for an endless life.</p>
            <p>O the folly of all those who have a God to serve, and a soul to save,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:205425:26"/>and a Heaven to enjoy, and a Hell to escape, and a death to prepare for, and that spend this life in worldly wicked vanities that perish in the using, and leave all their chief work undone; O possess us with serious thoughts of the folly and madness of those, that set more by a little meat and drink and beastly pleasure, for a few days, than by an endless Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory; that care more for a body that must rot in the earth, than for a never dying soul; that spare no pains to avoid shame, sorrow and sickness, and will do so little to avoid everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shame and horror in Hell.</p>
            <p>Oh give us to consider how sad it is for men to exercise their reason for trifles, and none for their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and are wise in nothing but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable vanities, and cunning to cheat themselves out of all their hopes of Heaven.</p>
            <p>O our God, let us love thee above all, with the sweetest and highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, bring us to Heaven by Grace,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:205425:26"/>save us from this miserable world.</p>
            <p>Fill us with everlasting hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly joys, the only cordial against all our calamities here below; O the reviving hopes of an endless Glory!</p>
            <p>This is that we live for in the world, we have nothing else can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our spirits for one day under all our crosses, but this comfortable fore-thought, that we shall be for ever with the Lord and all his Holy Glorified ones!</p>
            <p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath in him chosen us through faith to so great and glorious an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance prepared for all those that look for his Glorious appearance, even so <hi>Amen,</hi> come Lord Jesus, come quickly.</p>

            <p>MOst Gracious Lord, the God and Father of our blessed Lord Jesus: O what are we sinful dust and ashes, that we should enjoy so great a priviledge, to make our approaches into thy presence, and in the name of our Mediator and Advocate with thee, to pour out our souls, and that with good hope, through grace, to find grace and favour to help in our time of need!</p>
            <p>Our great request at this address of ours this morning is, that all our scales of ignorance and blindness may fall off, that we may no longer live ignorantly, carelesly or sinfully to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke thy Glorious Majesty; O give us a clear resolution of our conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reconciliation through our Lord Jesus, let us not be alwayes thinking that we stand; strengthen our Faith, that we may be followers
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:205425:27"/>of those who through faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence inherited the promise: Let repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to life evidence our truth of Grace, let sanctification witness our hope of salvation, let our death to sin witness our life and interest in our Lord Jesus. O give us to consider that light hath no communion with darkness, perswade us more and more of the impossibility of any unholy person, whilst such, to be forgiven, and saved. Sin is the souls misery, and to pardon a sinner is to deliver him from his misery. O make us sensible that there is no hopes of the salvation of a sinner that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in his unconverted condition, and that everlasting despair in Hell will be the Portion of all that dye unconverted and unsanctified. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of the necessity of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, repentance, conversion and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, without which none can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Inable us to trust God to be our only everlasting joy, and to be the Law giver and Ruler of our Lives.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:205425:28"/>And to trust Christ to justifie us and save us from our sins; and trust the Holy-Ghost to kill our sins, and to illuminate, sanctifie and quicken us, and by degrees to make us perfectly holy.</p>
            <p>O Let us never expect God will save us from Hell and not from sin, or from the guilt of sin and not from the power of sin, or that sinners should keep their sins whilst they live, and then to give them Heaven at death.</p>
            <p>Perswade our souls of the truth of our Repentance, which stands not in our opinion being changed, but it consists in the change of the heart and conversation.</p>
            <p>O give us that truth of repentance that reforms the worldly mind, as well as open wickedness: kill the love of every sin in us: set our hearts and hopes on Heaven, so that we may now love holiness and seek Gods Kingdom above this world. Keep us from a counterfeit repentance of sorrowing for sin and not amending
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:205425:28"/>our lives; or of sorrowing to day and sinning again to morrow. Oh deliver us from ignorance, unbelief and aversness or enmity to God and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, from pride, sensuality, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, disobedience and carnal sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fishness: O let our hearts submit to the holy Laws and ways of God: let us no longer live in slavery to the Devil, nor spend our time in the world to gratifie the flesh.</p>
            <p>O preserve us from the neglect of our salvation; above all callings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to make our Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction sure, through our Lord Jesus who hath loved us and given himself to death for all those that come la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and weary to him, and take up his Cross and follow him.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:205425:29"/>them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit, they only mind the things of the spirit, and to be spiritually mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is life and peace.

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from the works of the flesh, and fill us with the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: inable us more and more to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the flesh, with the affections and lusts. Let it appear that we are in Christ by the workmanship of the new creature. Let us not deceive our selves, he that doth righteousness is righteous, and that without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness no man shall see the Lord. O that the enmity within our own souls against these sacred rules might more affect our hearts to consider how we have forgot our God, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected our Saviour, despised Heaven, and slighted holiness, and a holy God, and holy Scriptures, and holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:205425:30"/>that have lost our precious time, and omitted holy duties, whereby we became the worst ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to our own salvation, for which cause we may justly loath our selves, for our sins and our self-ruine; all men might be holy and happy if they would in time apply themselves to it, but most men will not. O let not the world have more of our hearts than Heaven, let us no longer love plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure more than God: Let us no longer be more weary of holy thoughts, or holy Conference, or Prayer than of our worldly concerns.</p>
            <p>Deliver us from a proud, worldly, fleshly heart and life, which is the sting, and will give the sinner no rest! and the defiled guilty Conscience, which will never let the soul be quiet! Which hath a life of unpardoned sin to look back upon: a life of sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ungodliness, of pride, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and idleness, abundance of oaths, curses, lies and contempt of God; God hateth all the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

            <p>O The Greatness of that Love which the Angels came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare! and the multitude of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Host celebrated with Songs of Praise, at the birth of him who was sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, and in the form of a servant; yet wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conceived, by being formed by the immediate finger of the Spirit, the power of the most High oversha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing the blessed Virgin as it was foretold by the Angel at his Salutation; who was the brightness of his Fathers Glory, and the express image of his person, and the upholder of all things by the word of his power, at whose bringing into the world, he saith, And let all the Angels of God worship him. But unto the Son he saith, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:205425:43"/>a Scepter of righteousness is the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thy Kingdom; yet when he came into the world, neither the world, nor his own knew him, though he dwelt amongst them; but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believed on his name. So wonderful was his wisdom that the people cry out Whence hath this man this wisdom? in him were hid all the treasures of wisdom: O the riches of Grace to lost man that had forfeited all his mercies and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away all his hopes of blessedness, that then our Lord Jesus should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume our nature according to all those Prophecies and Promises made of old, that he should be born of a Virgin, and born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that Kings should offer unto him, that Children should be slain thinking thereby to murther him; that a Star should appear at his Birth, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:205425:43"/>that he should be betrayed by his Disciple, and that he should be sold for thirty pieces of Silver; that he should ride into <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> that he should be buffetted, spit on, scourged and dye amongst thieves, that Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar should be given him to drink, that his Apparel should be divided, and Lots cast for his Garments; that he should be crucified, and his side pierced; that he should rise from the dead the third day, and that he should ascend into Heaven. O the depth of this mercy, that the Divine Nature should stoop so low, and that the humane nature should be raised so high; that so low, lost and undone creatures should be made one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the Divine Nuture; that God and man should meet in one Person; great is the mysterie of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, for the Creator to become a creature, for the Son of God to be made sin and a curse, and all to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lost sinners; that in this union Heaven and Earth should embrace,

            <p>But yet further, O my soul, admire that blessed life of my Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and how powerfully and faithfully according to the Scriptures he hath confirmed all those miracles foretold and by him manifestly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whilest he was upon the earth; He turned Water into Wine, fed five thousand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. fed four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. gave sight to the Blind, speech the Dumb, restored the withered Hand, healed the lame that had been so thirty eight years, healed the Leprosie, the Feavor, the Palsie, the Bloody-Issue, the Dropsie, calm'd the Sea, walkt on the Waters, raised to life the dead, and delivered the possest from the Devil. And at his death no less wonderful to confirm his truths
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:205425:44"/>spoken to his Disciples and to all that believe. At his death he was betrayed by <hi>Judas,</hi> denied by <hi>Peter,</hi> condemned by <hi>Pilate</hi> though by false witnesses: yet O my soul forget not his love, who before his suffering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the remembrance of his death and suffering, taking bread when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave unto them, <hi>saying, This is my body;</hi> also the cup, saying, <hi>This is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament in my blood which is shed for you, this do in remembrance of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Legacy left to all that believe and obey him, he went to the Mount of Olives, and there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving advised his Disciples to pray, he withdrew from them and prayed, where there appeared an Angel to strengthen him, who in his Agony prayed the more earnestly; and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground: immediately after he was betrayed by <hi>Judas</hi> with a Kiss. Afterward in the High-Priests house he was mocked,

            <p>Oh wonderful King in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, a strange King in thy Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which was with the Spirit, his Scepter as strange wherewith he swayes, it is the word of his mouth, by which he subdues the heart, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes sin, and writes his Law in mens hearts.</p>
            <p>A strange King if we look upon the nature of his Kingdom, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy-Ghost: this Kingdom is upheld only by the power of the Eternal Spirit.</p>

            <p>O my soul consider a little this wonderful Priest, he is so a Priest, that he is also the Altar and the Sacrifice: the Sacrifice is his Humanity, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is his Divinity; the Priest is both these in their union; in which Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he hath made an end of sin, and brought in everlasting Righteousness.</p>
            <p>O wonderful Prophet, such a one that not only presents divine Truths to us, but gives light and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive those truths; he not only speaks out truth but unites truth and the soul together; yea he is both the Teacher and the truth taught. And how wonderful also is our Lord Jesus in his Resurrection! As his Nativity was revealed by Angels, so his Resurrection was also declared by Angels, and by himself confirmed by his ten several appearances after his Resurrection.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Mary,</hi> to the other <hi>Mary,</hi> to <hi>Joanna,</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> to the two Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> to the Eleven, to the Eleven <hi>Thomas</hi> being present, to

            <p>After so many witnesses of our Lords Resurrection, and having shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty dayes: and being assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, he commanded his Apostles that they should wait at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> for the promise of the Holy-Ghost; after which they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power to be witnesses unto Christ; which Spirit they received and were witnesses both in <hi>Jerusalem, Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and unto the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost parts of the Earth. And now is Christ risen and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father, the Salvation of God, the Fountain of Grace, the Heir of all things, the Portion of our Inheritance, our Righteousness, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Sanctification and Redemption, and hope of Glory; the chief Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and Bishop of our souls, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:205425:46"/>of the world, the King of the Jews, the Salvation and light of the Gentiles: Having by his work of Redemption raised up Salvation, wonderfully conquered Satan, done away sin, brought in Righteousness, satisfied Justice; and thus the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of mans necessity is fully answered, God coming down into communion with man in his sin, shame, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and misery; and then drawing up man into communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his own Righteousness, Power, Blessedness and Glory.

            <p>O Most holy, just and dreadful Lord God, yet gracious and ready to receive poor sinners, who repentingly return unto thee by faith in Christ; I hear from thy word, that thou hast redeemed the world by Jesus Christ, and he hath satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Justice as a propitiation for our sins, and hath merited thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning saving grace, for all that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe and repent, and heartily accept of Christ for the saving work and benefits of his mediation. But I hear, that except we repent, we shall all perish; and that he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not shall be damned; and that except we be born again of the Spirit, and be converted; and that without holiness none shall see thee; and that if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his; and that all that are in Christ are
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:205425:53"/>new Creatures; old things are pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed away, and all things are become new; and that the carnal mind is enmity, and neither is nor can be subject to thy law; and that Christ is the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him. I am convinc't that thou art best, and best to me; and that I should love thee with all my heart, and vilifie all the pleasures, and Riches, and Honours of this world in comparison of thee: I am convinc't that all this world is vanity; and that Heaven alone where thou art seen, and perfectly loved and praised, is the only felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of souls. I am convinced that thou art the first and last, of whom and through whom, and to whom, both I and all things are. But alas, the hardness of my heart, the power of unbelief and fleshly lusts, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against all this conviction! I fear lest all my knowledge should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me to be beaten with many stripes; when I know that I should
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:205425:54"/>do good, evil is present with me; and the will of the flesh prevaileth against thy holy will. The custom of sinning hath increased my sinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: Long have I been wishing and purposing to repent, and come to thee; but alas, how many purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses have I changed, and how many promises have I broken, and how many wishes have come to nothing? O that I had a heart, a will to love thee as much above all the world, as I know I should love thee! and to delight in thee, and in thy holy ways, in thy Grace and in the hopes of Glory. O that I had a heart would enlargedly run the way of thy Commandments, and did delight to do thy will O God; and did still obey thee from the power of love! O that the new nature did more strongly encline me to thee, and to thy service, than my corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture enclineth me to the interest of carnal self and sense! O that I had a heart to believe in Christ, as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:205425:54"/>strongly as I know I should believe in him; and to hate sin as much as I am convinced that I should hate it, and to live by faith and not by sight! I have corrupted this heart, O Lord, but I cannot renew it; I have defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, but cannot cleanse it; I have kindled in it the fire of sinful lusts, but I cannot quench it: I have none to fly to now, or in the hour of my last extremity, but that God whom I have so heinously offended! I have none to trust in, but the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our whom I have so unthankfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected! I have none to regenerate and make clean my soul, but the same Spirit whom I have so long resisted! Have mercy upon me, O God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatness of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. My time is going, O precious time! It is going, Lord, and almost gone; I have but a few more breaths to breath, and I am gone from hence for ever, and yet alas my work is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, my soul is unready! If I dye this night, O where shall I awake,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:205425:55"/>and where must I take up my endless dwelling! It is thy wonderful mercy which hath kept me alive and from Hell so long! The time that is past will never return!

I have not so set my heart

Forgive me my sins through the sacrifice and intercession of my Redeemer. O try me once more with the opportunities and means of grace! Return, O Lord, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my soul, O save me for thy mercies sake! Kill me not, till my sin be killed! End not this life till thou hast prepared me for a better! Cut not off my time, till I am ready for eternity! Let me not die in my sins, nor fall into the hands of thy reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging justice! O give me yet both time and grace!

            <head>A brief relation of the Gunpowder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son Plot.</head>
            <p>THe Plot was designed to destroy King, Peers and Parliament at one Blow, by undermining the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-house. This damnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was contrived and prosecuted by the Popish Priests, and others of that faction; and the Conspirators inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in an Oath of fecrelle, by taking the Sacrament to ratifie the design the more Hellishly.</p>
            <p>The day was appointed and all things prepared ready; <hi>November</hi> the fifth 1605 was the day for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but about ten days before a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was sent to the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> the Contents whereof so troubled him, that he presently imparts it to the Secretary of State, and he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately presents it to the King; which was to this effect, To advise the said, Lord to be tender of his own preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as he tendred his life, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:205425:68"/>to study to shift off his attendance at this Parliament; for God and man had concurred to punish the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for though there be no appearance of any stir, yet, I say, they shall receive a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blow this Parliament, and yet they shall not see who hurts them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King reading this Letter, did immediately conclude by the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dark sentences, that this Blow must be by Gunpowder. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on strict search being made under the Parliament-house at midnight, the very night before the Parliament sate, at the dore at the entrance of the Cellar, was found one <hi>Guy Faux</hi> Cloathed and Booted, who being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, upon farther search, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving some Billets they found thirty six Barrels of Gunpowder; and searching the Traytor, they find about him a Dark Lanthorn, and three Matches, and other instruments for blowing up the Powder.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:205425:68"/>
            <p>This horrid Plot thus being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the King, Peers and Commons were preserved, and the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors received their deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

I confess, Lord, I have sinned against Heaven, and against Earth, and in thy sight, and I am no more worthy to be called a Child of God. I have forfeited all thy mercies, I have grieved thy most Holy Spirit, and gratified the Devil, and wronged my own soul; and now, Lord, I have no rest, thine Arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth me sore; there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any rest in my bones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of my sins: for mine iniquities are gone over my head as an heavy burden, they are too heavy for me to bear. I have sinned, what shall I do
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:205425:93"/>to thee, O thou preserver of men? I will glorifie thy justice, and say The Lord is just and I am a sinner. Just and true are thy wayes thou King of Saints, to send thy terrors into a soul that would not be sensible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations of thy mercy, and to make me feel thy wrath who have been a great abuser of thy grace, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor of thy holy Commandments. Merciful God, thou who in wrath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrest mercy, let me find so much mercy, in and by thy wrath, that mine own wickedness may correct me, and my backslidings may reprove me; and make me know and feel that 'tis an evil and bitter thing to sin against God, and that thy fear was not in me. O Lord, I have committed two evils, I have forsaken thee the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living waters, and have hewen to my self Cisterns, broken Cisterns that can hold no water; I have forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee the only true good, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the sinful pleasures and deceitful promises of the world and the flesh,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:205425:94"/>which have disappointed me of my hopes. I have treasured up wrath against the day of wrath, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of thy righteous judgements. O Lord, thou desirest not the death of a sinner, but hadst rather that he repent and live; and 'tis to recover such great sinners as I am that thou hast provided the greatest of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, thy most precious Son, one God with thy self and thy Spirit; who in obedience to thee, and out of mercy and compassion to us thy defaced ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, hath taken upon him our weak flesh, and in it hath yielded himself to the cursed death of the Cross, and presented to thy Soveraign justice the unvaluable price of his blood and merit, a full and perfect ransom for the greatest of sinners; that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish but have everlasting life: Lord I believe, help thou my unbelief, the great sickness of my afflicted soul sinking under the burden of sin, and so begin my cure. Grant that it may
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:205425:94"/>be the burden of my sins indeed that lye heavy upon me, rather than the horror of thy judgements. O teach me perfectly to hate those offences which I have committed against thee the most great and glorious God, my most watchful Protector, my most bountiful Benefactor, my tender-hearted Father, who hast not dealt with me after my sins, nor rewarded me according to mine iniquities. My God, with this loathing of my sins, give me stedfast purpose to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them, and to be more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and constant to seek to please thee, and to glorifie thee in my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and in my Spirit, which are thine, than ever I was eager to follow the sinful courses of this wicked world. Create in me a clean heart, O God, renew a right spirit within me by thy sanctifying Spirit, and by the same heal now the sores of my sad soul. O Lord pardon me, Lord accept of me in thy beloved Son. Lord make me to hear of Joy and Gladness, that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:205425:95"/>the bones that thou hast broken may rejoyce in thy salvation, and more yet in the duties of thy service, through Jesus Christ my Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

O speak unto my heart, Seek thou my face, speak it Lord, and enable my heart to say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek. Lord speak the word and thy servant shall be healed; O hide not thy face far from me, put not thy servant away in anger; thou hast been my help, leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. O blessed Lord who didst heal so many diseased per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and saidst unto them withall, Thy sins are forgiven thee: speak that comfortable word unto me a sad ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of thy compassion.

Work within me a new creation, the illumination of thy holy knowledge, and the light of holiness and heavenly comforts, that I may without disturbance tend the duties of thy service, and that I may see the beauty of holiness and rejoyce in it, and glorifie thee by my light in it.

               <p>O Lord, as we have received from thee, so we return the praise of all to thee; we bless thee for our Creation, Preservation and all the blessings of this life; but more especially for the Redemption of the World by our Lord Jesus Christ. Enable us we pray thee to continue in the way of well-doing, to thy honour and glory; and bless the Universal Church, the King, Queen and Realm, and send us peace and truth, through Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
